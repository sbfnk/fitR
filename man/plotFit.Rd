\usage{
plotFit(
  fitmodel,
  theta,
  initState,
  data,
  nReplicates = 1,
  summary = TRUE,
  alpha = min(1, 10/nReplicates),
  allVars = FALSE,
  nonExtinct = NULL,
  observation = TRUE,
  plot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fitmodel}{a \code{\link{fitmodel}} object}

\item{theta}{named numeric vector. Values of the parameters. Names should
match \code{fitmodel$thetaNames}.}

\item{initState}{named numeric vector. Initial values of the state
variables. Names should match \code{fitmodel$stateNames}.}

\item{data}{data frame. Observation times and observed data. The time column
must be named \code{"time"} and the observation column must be named
\code{"obs"}.}

\item{nReplicates}{numeric, number of replicated simulations.}

\item{summary}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the mean, median as well as the 50th
and 95th percentile of the trajectories are plotted (default). If
\code{FALSE}, all individual trajectories are plotted (transparency can be
set with \code{alpha}).}

\item{alpha}{transparency of the trajectories (between 0 and 1).}

\item{allVars}{logical, if \code{FALSE} only the observations are plotted.
Otherwise, all state variables are plotted.}

\item{nonExtinct}{character vector. Names of the infected states which must
be non-zero so the epidemic is still ongoing.  When the names of these
states are provided, the extinction probability is plotted by computing the
proportion of faded-out epidemics over time.  An epidemic has faded-out
when all the infected states (whose names are provided) are equal to 0.
This is only relevant for stochastic models.  In addition, if \code{summary
== TRUE}, the summaries of the trajectories conditioned on non-extinction
are shown. Default to \code{NULL}.}

\item{observation}{logical, if \code{TRUE} simulated observation are
generated by \code{rTrajObs}.}

\item{plot}{if \code{TRUE} the plot is displayed, and returned otherwise.}
}
\value{
if \code{plot == FALSE}, a list of 2 elements is returned:
\itemize{
    \item \code{simulations} \code{data.frame} of \code{nReplicates}
  simulated observations.
    \item \code{plot} the plot of the fit.
}
}
\description{
This function simulates the model under \code{theta}, generates observation
and plot them against the data. Since simulation and observation processes
can be stochastic, \code{nReplicates} can be plotted.
